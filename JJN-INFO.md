# JJN-INFO: SHORTNER

## Alright, Listen Up Future Me

So, you built this thing called `Shortner`. It's a tiny, self-hosted URL shortener written in Go because, let's be real, long URLs are a crime against humanity. You made this because your inbox was turning into an unmanageable hellscape of tracking-infested URLs, and you figured, "Hey, I can fix this!"

Also, let's be honestâ€”you just wanted an excuse to mess around with Go again.

## What This Project Does (In Case You Forget)
- **Shortens URLs** because nobody needs to see `utm_source=nightmare&utm_campaign=chaos`
- **Works with Nginx** because why expose a Go app directly?
- **Stores links in SQLite** because you're too lazy to set up Postgres for this
- **Auto-cleans expired links** because clutter is bad
- **Self-hosted** because you donâ€™t trust third-party services (good job, paranoid self)

## The Stuff You Always Forget (But Need)

### .env Configuration (Don't Skip This!)
Before running anything, copy the example `.env` and tweak it:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Then, edit it with your **own damn values**:
```ini
LOG_PATH=app.log
LOG_LEVEL=debug
CACHE_EXPIRY=30  # Cleanup after X days
SHORT_DOMAIN=https://my.short.link  # Should match Nginx setup
PORT=8889
```

## Running This Locally (When You Inevitably Need to Debug)
1. **Check if you even have Go installed:**
   ```bash
   go version
   ```
   If that fails, wellâ€¦ go install Go.

2. **Run it in dev mode:**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

3. **Or build the binary and run it:**
   ```bash
   go build -o shortener
   ./shortener
   ```

4. **Test it works:**
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8889/shorten?url=https://example.com?utm_source=spam"
   ```
   Expected output:
   ```
   https://my.short.link/a1b2c3
   ```

5. **Check redirection:**
   ```bash
   curl -L "https://my.short.link/a1b2c3"
   ```
   If it doesnâ€™t work, time to go debugging!

## Deploying This Beast With GoReleaser
Because manually building stuff is for suckers.

### **Build It Locally First**
```bash
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
```

That should:
- Compile binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows (because why not?)
- Zip and tar.gz them up neatly
- Generate checksums so you feel like a pro

### **Tag a Release (Because You Always Forget)**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare release v1.0.0"
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "First official release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```
Boom. That triggers **GitHub Actions**, builds everything, and uploads it automagically.

## Running It as a Systemd Service (So It Survives Reboots)
Create the service file `/etc/systemd/system/shortener.service`:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Shortner Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/path/to/shortener
WorkingDirectory=/path/to
Restart=always
User=ubuntu
EnvironmentFile=/path/to/.env
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reload systemd and start it:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable shortener
sudo systemctl start shortener
```

Check if it's alive:
```bash
sudo systemctl status shortener
```
If itâ€™s dead, time to dig into logs and cry a little.

## Future Meâ€™s To-Do List
- **Improve Logging** â€“ Because right now itâ€™s "just enough" and thatâ€™s never actually enough.
- **Better Expiry Handling** â€“ Maybe let users choose different expiration rules?
- **Admin Dashboard?** â€“ Maybe, if you're feeling fancy.
- **Track Usage Stats** â€“ Because, why not? Would be cool to know how many links you shorten.

Okay, that's everything. If you're reading this, you either broke something or forgot how your own project works. Either way, good luck, future me. You're gonna need it. ðŸš€
